**ANST JavaScript Arithmetic Operations Assignment**

**Overview**

This assignment involves creating a simple JavaScript program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and prints the results in a clear format.

**Task**

Write a JavaScript program that does the following:

Declare two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any two numbers.

Perform the following arithmetic operations and store the results in separate variables:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

Modulus (%)

Print the results in a clear format.

**Example Code**
// Declare two variables and assign them any two numbers
let num1 = 20;
let num2 = 5;

// Perform arithmetic operations
let addition = num1 + num2;
let subtraction = num1 - num2;
let multiplication = num1 * num2;
let division = num1 / num2;
let modulus = num1 % num2;

// Print the results
console.log("Numbers =", "num1 =", num1, ", num2 =", num2);
console.log("Addition =", addition);
console.log("Subtraction =", subtraction);
console.log("Multiplication =", multiplication);
console.log("Division =", division);
console.log("Modulus =", modulus);

**Expected Output**
Numbers = num1 = 20 , num2 = 5
Addition = 25
Subtraction = 15
Multiplication = 100
Division = 4
Modulus = 0

**How to Run the Program**

Copy and paste the code into a JavaScript file (e.g., script.js).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the file is located.

Run the script using Node.js: **node script.js**

**How to Push to GitHub**

Ensure Git is installed on your system.

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

Run the following commands:
git add .
git commit -m "Added JavaScript arithmetic operations program"
git push origin main
